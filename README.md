# Infura transactions demo

ITX makes transaction sending easy. It takes care of the edge cases of getting a transaction mined, so you don't have to.

This repository contains a comparison of how traditional compares to using ITX. You'll find a collection of code samples that show you how to interact with Ethereum using:

- [The standard approach](standard-transactions): you're probably already familiar with this approach. Transactions are sent directly from a user wallet with the help of a popular library like [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) or [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

- [Infura Transactions](infura-transactions): here you'll find examples for using the new [Infura Transactions](https://infura.io/docs/ethereum#tag/Transactions) service.
